# Cats-vs-Dogs CNN Project

## Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses a dataset of labeled images to train and evaluate the performance of the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Dogs vs. Cats. Download and extract the dataset into the data/ directory.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project consists of:

Convolutional layers
Max-Pooling layers
Fully Connected layers
Dropout for regularization
The architecture is defined in model.py.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 91% on the validation set. The results are evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
